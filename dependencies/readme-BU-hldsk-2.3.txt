HL SDK 2.3 (steam updated, Bots-United internal version)

consider this a basic running version, it's neither official nor claiming to be complete, it just a
matter of fact, that compiling against the multiplayer subdirectory wokrs for compiling bots in linux.

included:
./hlsdk-2.3-metamod-patched-rbupdated  -> hlsdk2.3 from metamod.org updated with stuff Stefan metioned to me
                                          and overwritten with the updated_eiface.tgz (*note the readme is
                                          not so clear, i copied the files into multi and singleplayer
                                          as well as into two subdirs (for files Sequence.h + archtypes.h to
                                          /engine and /common).

note:
for a hlsdk with a working metamod and a sample bot source (hpb_bot) look for the file hl_bot_build.tar.bz2.

Have fun :-)
