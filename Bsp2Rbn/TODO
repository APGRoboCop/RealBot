log
@- version is 0.9.7
- only one added feature: detecting CONTENT_WATER by checking all func_water
  entities
@
text
@- incorporate into realbot dll
- reduce the number of nodes (specially useless ones) perhaps by making two passes
  and removing nodes without path to spawnpoints
- compute the RBX based on risk (i.e. how many nodes can attack this nodes)
- handle ducking (like the airduct in cs_siege)
- create important sniper point based on how many nodes can be seen from this node
- ...

log
@- bumped version to 0.9.6
- slightly better 'GUI' to show progress
- it took long, I lost hair ;-), but TraceHull is now fully implemented
  without the HL engine, just by looking into BSP, w00t !
- added a COPYING file for GPL
- better wall avoidance when creating a node
- handling of func_wall & func_illusionary (for de_aztec bridge)
@

@a0 1
- handle tracelines into water (handle entity func_water)
@


1.3
log
@News stuff TODO related to water and de_aztec bridge
@
text
@a0 3
- handle a real hull instead of traceline (not easy without the HL engine)
  this would probably require handling 'consistent' func_wall or func_illusionary
  in addition to worldspan

- it compiles eventually on Windows with mingw...
