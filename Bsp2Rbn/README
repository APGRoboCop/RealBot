Realbot utilities
=================

This package has three utilities:
- Bsp2Rbn: convert a BSP file to RBN and RBX files
- DumpNodes: analyze a RBN files looking for trouble (isolated nodes, ...)
- DrawNodes: a standalone version of 'realbot nodes dumpbmp'

BSP2RBN
-------

This is an attempt to convert BSP file (with all information about faces, ...) into
a Realbot nodes file (RBN).

It heavily relies on idea from
- PMB about walkable face, ...
- Botman for handling the BSP files and objects

It will eventually be included within the realbot DLL itself.

It is easy to use it:
Bsp2Rnb mapfile

and it will create a .RBN & RBX files in the current directory.

Those files need to be copied into ..\realbot\data\cstrike\maps
and ..\realbot\data\cstrike\exp

It works by creating nodes for:
- ladders (top, middle and bottom) with the specific ladder flag
- spawn points, bombspots, ...
- all vertexes of all walkable faces
- all middle points  of all egdes/medians of walkable faces

NB: nodes generated from walkable faces are actually 'moved' a little
towards the center of the face in a attempt to avoid putting
a node too close to a wall.

Nodes are created by the normal Realbot procedure call, this call
will handle the neighbour creation.

All nodes are created 36 units above the ground.

As Bsp2Rbn is a standalone utility, there is no Half-Life engine
running, so, some important functions are simply emulated notably
TraceHull.
